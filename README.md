Hi, I’m Prudhveer Reddy

Data engineering learner with a mechanical engineering background from NIT Warangal. I work on building simple, reliable data systems using Python and SQL, with a focus on clarity, correctness, and automation.

I approach data problems using engineering principles: break the problem down, validate inputs early, and build solutions that are easy to understand and maintain.

Projects

Fraud Detection System (Python, Machine Learning)
Processed 3500 transaction records, performed feature engineering, and evaluated baseline machine learning models such as logistic regression and decision trees. The system automated manual pattern checks and achieved consistent classification performance.

Stock Market Data Pipeline (Python, MySQL)
Built an automated Python-to-MySQL ETL pipeline for daily stock data ingestion across multiple tickers. Enabled SQL-based trend analysis including moving averages and price range tracking, eliminating manual data collection.

Bank Transaction Statement System (SQL Automation)
Designed relational schemas and ingested 800 transaction records from CSV files. Automated verification and categorization logic, enabling fast identification of recurring and unusual spending patterns across multiple categories.

3D Mapping and Surface Reconstruction
Generated dense point clouds from image datasets using Meshroom, CloudCompare, and MeshLab. Worked on feature matching, alignment, noise filtering, and mesh reconstruction, reinforcing structured data processing and transformation workflows.

Areas of Interest

ETL automation, SQL design, data pipelines, analytics workflows, and applying engineering discipline to data systems. Open to technical discussions and collaboration.
