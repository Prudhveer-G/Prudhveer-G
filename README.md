### Data Engineering Learner | Python & SQL | ETL Systems

Mechanical Engineering graduate from NIT Warangal with an engineering-first approach to data problems. I focus on building simple, reliable data pipelines using Python and SQL, with emphasis on correctness, clarity, and maintainability.

I approach data work by breaking problems into clear steps, validating assumptions early, and designing systems that remain predictable under routine use.

## Projects

**Fraud Detection System (Python, Machine Learning)**  
Processed 3500 transaction records, engineered features, and evaluated baseline machine learning models including logistic regression and decision trees. Automated manual pattern checks and improved consistency in transaction classification.

**Stock Market Data Pipeline (Python, MySQL)**  
Built an automated Python-to-MySQL ETL pipeline for daily stock data ingestion across multiple tickers. Enabled SQL-based trend analysis such as moving averages and price range tracking, removing manual data collection.

**Bank Transaction Statement System (SQL Automation)**  
Designed relational schemas and ingested 800 transaction records from CSV files. Automated verification and categorization logic, enabling fast identification of recurring and unusual spending patterns across multiple categories.

**3D Mapping and Surface Reconstruction**  
Generated dense point clouds from image datasets using Meshroom, CloudCompare, and MeshLab. Worked on feature matching, alignment, noise filtering, and mesh reconstruction, reinforcing structured data processing workflows.
